For Data preprocessing, I employed my scraper to grab the specific street music samples from the UrbanSounds8K dataset. For whatever reason, in this dataset there are ten folders that are not evenly organized (instead of there being one category per folder,
each folders contains samples from all ten categories), so creating this scraper was necessary in order to expedite things.

The actual preprocessor file follows a guide I found on Medium.com, but I adapted it for tensorflow rather than PyCharm. Interestingly, the Medium article utilized the same dataset but for a classification problem rather than a generative one.
